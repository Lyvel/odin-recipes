        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>250g Regular Flour</li>
            <li>1 Pack Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Cinnamon</li>
            <li>115g Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>150g Dark Sugar</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>80g Plain or Greek Yogurt</li>
            <li>460g Mashed Bananas</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set your oven to 175c and spray loaf pan with non stick spray</li>
            <li>Mash the bananas in the mixer using the whisk attachment then pour into a large bowl</li>
            <li>Add the yogurt to the bananas and mix in</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat the butter and sugar together until smooth and creamy using the paddle attachment on the mixer.</li>
            <li>Add an egg at a time on medium speed, then add the bananas and yogurt mix.</li>
            <li>With the mixer running on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not over mix.</li>
            <li>Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60-65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with tin foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be after 60-65 minutes depending on your oven, so being checking every 5 minutes around the 60 minute mark.</li>
        </ol>
